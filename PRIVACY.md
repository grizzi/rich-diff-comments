# Privacy Policy — Markdown PR — Markdown PR Comments for GitHub

**Effective date:** May 18, 2026

Markdown PR — Markdown PR Comments for GitHub is a browser extension that adds inline commenting to GitHub Pull Request rich-diff (rendered markdown) views.

## What data the extension accesses

The extension runs as a content script on `https://github.com/*/pull/*` pages. While on those pages it reads:

- The rendered DOM of the page (paragraphs, headings, tables, code blocks) to position comment affordances.
- The raw markdown source of files in the PR, fetched from the same `github.com` origin.
- Existing review threads and PR metadata, fetched from the same `github.com` origin.
- Mentionable-user suggestions for `@mention` autocomplete, fetched from the same `github.com` origin.

## What data the extension sends

The extension sends data **only to `github.com`**, the same origin you are already logged into. Requests are made on your behalf using the session cookies your browser already holds for `github.com`, with no separate authentication. Specifically:

- New review comments and replies are posted to `github.com` via the same endpoints the GitHub web UI itself uses.
- Resolve / unresolve actions on review threads, again via GitHub's own endpoints.
- A markdown preview request to `github.com/preview` to render the comment-preview tab.
- A user-suggestions request to `github.com/suggestions/...` for `@mention` autocomplete.

No data is sent to any other server, analytics provider, or third party. The extension contains no telemetry.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `host_permissions: https://github.com/*` | Required to read GitHub pages and make same-origin requests to GitHub's review-comment endpoints. |

The extension does not request any other permissions and does not have access to any other websites.

## Local storage

The extension stores the following in your browser's local storage (`localStorage`), all under the `github.com` origin:

- `grdc_sidebar_*`: sidebar position, size, collapsed state, active tab, and the unresolved-only filter toggle — UI preferences only.

The extension never stores credentials. It holds no Personal Access Token, no password, and no copy of your session cookies. These keys can be cleared at any time from your browser's DevTools (`Application → Storage → Local Storage`).

## Authentication

The extension does not handle, store, or transmit your GitHub password. Authentication is performed entirely by your browser's existing GitHub session cookies. Requests succeed only if your normal GitHub account would be allowed to perform the same action.

## Children

The extension is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect any data from children.

## Changes

Any future change to this policy will be committed to the extension's source repository and reflected in the published version.

## Contact

The extension is open-source. Source and issues:
